Overview
--------------------------------

Yuhm is an interpretation of the classic arcade game Dig Dug. Adapted for college students, the game takes
place in a library where the main character's goal is to collect cookies while avoiding the angry librarians.
If the librarians catch the student, the game is over! If, however, the student can collect enough cookies,
they can activate a snack break to momentarily freeze the librarians in place for a short time.
When all of the cookies are collected, the student can move on to the next level. The goal of the game is to
see how far you can go. Can you get the highest score?

Goals
-------------------------------

The goal of this project is as follows:

*	To demonstrate an understanding and implementation of Android Studio and associated app development software

Intended Audience
-------------------------------

Yuhm has been designed with the following audiences in mind:

*	Yuhm is designed for people of all backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, and ages
*	Anyone can play Yuhm as an easy way to relax, pass the time, and most importantly, to have fun!

Design Details
------------------------------

### The Student:

*	The student is the main character in the game, who you control, and can move around the library attempting to evade the librarians while collecting cookies.
*	The student is controlled by a D-Pad in the lower left corner that allows them to move up, right, down, and left

### The Librarians:

*	The librarians attempt to catch the student and stop them from eating in the library. If the librarian catches the student, the game is over and the student loses!

### The Trail:

*	As the student moves, they leave cookie crumbs behind, which the librarians can use to follow the student in their attempt to catch them
*	The librarians can only follow the paths they start on or the trail of cookie crumbs left by the student

### Snack Break:

*	When the student has collected 3 cookies, they can activate a snack break, freezing all librarians in place for a short time
*	Snack Break is activated by a button in the lower right corner which becomes available when the student collects enough cookies. It will then reset

### Winning the Game:

*	The student attempts to collect all the cookies in the level to gain points
*	If all the cookies in a level are collected the student moves on to the next level
*	The goal is to get the highest score possible
*	Score is calculated based on amount of cookies collected and time spent alive

### Losing the game:

*	If the student is caught by a librarian, the game is over. Your score is then recorded and you can input your name. You then have the option to return to the main menu or restart
